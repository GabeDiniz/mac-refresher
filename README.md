# mac-optimizer ðŸš€

mac-optimizer is a shell scripts designed to declutter, streamline, and boost the performance of your MacBook. If your Mac has been feeling slow, bogged down by caches, logs, and other temporary files, this script is here to help!

I created this script because of my wife... She has a MacBook and frequently tells me "my macbook is slow again, can you fix it". Hopefully, this does.
